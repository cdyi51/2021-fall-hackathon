“What Pokemon are you?” Quiz:

Description:
This quiz asks a series of personality and preference questions. It then uses your responses to determine what Pokemon best fits your personality. 

Concepts used: 
If-else statements: Based on the responses, a certain number of points is added to a specific variable. 
Dictionaries: We created a dictionary of the Pokemon and the points associated with each in order to determine which Pokemon was most like the quiz-taker. 
Adding points and returning a max: Each response will add points to a variable named after a Pokemon. At the end, the Pokemon variable with the most points is returned. 
Append: We appended a new user every time new took the quiz.
Built-in functions: The max function was used to find the max value in a dictionary.

Challenges overcome:
We learned how to utilize a drop-down menu to respond to a multiple-choice question.
We learned how to make clicking the "submit" button trigger the loop to see which Pokemon variable had the most points.
Successfully figured out how specific html methods allows us to call variables and functions

New concepts learned:
How to code in html and CSS
How to use Python in conjunction with other coding languages

Team members/contributions:
Audrey came up with the idea to make a quiz about Pokemon. Audrey and Christina made the questions together, and Audrey put each question into a function that added points to each Pokemon variable. Christina consulted TAs and figured out how to combine the Python elements and HTML code correctly, allowing for the helper functions to be called and overall link the submit button to everything. She then created a result function to return the final Pokemon. Christina pointed out that errors were occuring due to the conditionals being coded incorrectly, so Audrey fixed each function to make the if-else statements nested. Christina searched styling for HTML and changed the background color and centered text.

Goals Achieved:
Successfully wrote functions for each question
Successfully displayed all the questions and answer choices on the website
Successfully created a loop to find the Pokemon variable with the most points

Goals outstanding/future work:
Making the website more colorful and visually appealing
We could add more questions to make the quiz more detailed
